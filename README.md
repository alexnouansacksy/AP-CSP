# 1. Setting Up

For me the hardest step was actually setting up my C environment, so I'm going to be explaining how to do it step by step.

How to actually compile and run C files!

Okay so with CLion, there are actually a couple ways to run your programs that are pretty cool.

## CLion

If you are running your programs in CLion, all you have to do is hit the 'Run' button in the top left.\
![run](images/run.png)

However, there are a few steps if you have multiple C soure files, or else you will get an error.



## Using the Terminal in CLion

#### 1. Open the Terminal in CLion
![terminal](images/terminal.png)

#### 2. Run these two commands.
```
gcc (FILE_NAME).c -o (EXE_FILE_NAME)
.\(EXE_FILE_NAME)
```
**FILE_NAME:** the name of your C file\
**EXE_FILE_NAME:** what you want to name your .exe file that will run the code

`gcc (FILE_Name.c -o (EXE_FILE_NAME)` generates the .exe file, which we need in order to run the code\
`.\(EXE_FILE_NAME` is how we actually run the code
