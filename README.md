Hello, today we will be learning how to program in C! While C is a very useful language,
there are some limitations. For example, there are no Strings in C, and instead there 
are only Character arrays. Because of this, for some of our notes we will be using
features from C++.

# 1. Compiling and Running

Alright so first you want to install GCC which you can do [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6juv3mIr9o&t=83s&ab_channel=NickWalton) and install desired GCC version.

After that you go install Visual Studio code.

After that you go to the extensions tab in your VS code and install "C/C++", "C/C++ Extension Pack", and "Code Runner."

After that you go to your Code Runner settings and turn on Run in Terminal and Save on Run.

After that you go create your "name".c program and change "name" to whatever you want, and then hit the run button.

Now your code compiles and runs!

# 2. Data Types



| Data Type  | Size (bytes) | Format | Example |
|-------|------|
| int  | 2 | %d  | 1 2 3 |
| char  | 1 | %d  | a b c 1 2 3 |
| double  | 8 | %lf  | r1c2 |
| bool  | 1 | N/A  | true false |
